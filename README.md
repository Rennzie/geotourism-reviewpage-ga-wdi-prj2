## <a name="brief"></a>Brief
You should create a platform for reviewing restaurants (**or something else**), (think a mini version of [Tripadvisor restaurants](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurants) that meets the following minimum criteria:

Technical Requirements:

- **Have at least 2 models** â€“ one representing a user and one that represents the main resource of your app.
- **Include relationships** - embedded or referenced. Make sure you take the time to consider the best approach before building out your models.
- **The app should include authentication** - with encrypted passwords & an authorization flow.
- **Have complete RESTful routes** for at least one of your resources with all CRUD actions.
- **Include wireframes** - that you designed before building the app.
- Have semantically clean HTML - you make sure you write HTML that makes structural sense rather than thinking about how it might look, which is the job of CSS.
- Be deployed online and accessible to the public.

MVP Deliverables:
- Has a User model and user authentication.
- Has models for Restaurants and Reviews.
- Allow users to add, edit and delete restaurants and reviews.
- Users can only delete their own reviews or restaurants added.
- Is styled with Bulma, but doesn't look like Bulma.
